## 🧭 About Me

I am a data scientist passionate about building intelligent systems at the intersection of **healthcare, machine learning, and generative AI**. With a solid foundation in statistics, deep learning, and NLP, I thrive in complex problem spaces and enjoy pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with modern AI.

My experience at **ZS Associates**, a global healthcare consulting firm, equipped me to excel in **high-pressure, fast-paced environments**. There, I led machine learning initiatives, streamlined analytics pipelines, and mentored new team members—all while delivering impactful solutions for top pharmaceutical clients.

At **NeuraFlash - Accenture** I was a main conrtibutor to the NeuraFlash multi agent chatbot product, grounded in RAG and built with ADK, which is then deployed for varied client use cases.

Currently pursuing my Master’s at the University of Chicago, I’m actively working on a capstone project that applies **LLMs and agentic frameworks** to real-world clinical settings, combining **multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and **reinforcement learning**.

## 🔬 Key Projects

### 🧠 [Capstone: Generative AI in Healthcare](https://github.com/johnmelel/capstone)
- Designing a **centralized vector store** with **multimodal RAG** and **agent-based reasoning** to enhance clinical decision support at UChicago Medicine
- Leveraging frameworks like **A2A**, **MCP**, and **LangGraph** to implement **multi-agent LLM pipelines**

### 🧪 [NLP for Clinical Trial Augmentation](https://github.com/johnmelel/MachineLearning1_CT)
- Extracted ideal patient cohorts for clinical trials from medical data and doctors’ notes using **NLP pipelines** and **PU classification**
- Helped simulate patient inclusion strategies to enhance clinical trial success with faster patient identification

### 🎭 [Conditional-Variational Autoencoder for Facial Age Progression](https://github.com/bhstoller/AgeTransform-VAE)
- Trained a **C-VAE** model to simulate age progression from facial portraits
- Integrated custom encoder-decoder architecture with PyTorch

### 🌫 [Forecasting London's Air Quality Index](https://github.com/johnmelel/TimeSeries_AQI_Forecasting)
- Developed a **deep learning-based LSTM model** to forecast London's Air Quality Index (AQI) using over 10 years of hourly data
- Benchmarked performance across multiple models: **ARIMA, SARIMA, ARFIMA, ETS, BSTS, and LSTM**
- Achieved best performance with **LSTM (RMSE = 10.2)**, significantly outperforming traditional statistical approaches
